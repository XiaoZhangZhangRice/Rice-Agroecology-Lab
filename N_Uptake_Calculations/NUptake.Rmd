# N uptake calculations

N uptake for PI and 50% heading are determined from non-segregated plant parts.
i.e. the whole plant was ground to a powder together and is representative of the crop's N uptake.
As most of the tissue here is vegetative, we assume that ambient moisture is the same as straw (8.27%)

N uptake for maturity are determined from separated plant parts - grain and straw.
This step calculates N present in grain and straw, but do not sum them yet.
Moisture for is 8.27% for straw and 9.76% for grains.

Dry samples were measured after stabilizing in the oven for a period of time (\>24hrs) and was measured to be 1.9%.

For 2023, we directly used yield.
Grain yield was reported at 14%

For 2023, grain was harvested by combine.
A sub-sample was taken to evaluate N uptake.
Harvest index (HI) was quantified from this subsample and used to estimate straw weight.

#Getting: g N per g of microbalanced sample (g/g)

master$N_per_g_microbalanced_sample <- ((master$SIF_N_Âµg)/(master$Sample_Weight_mg))/1000

#Dry sample weight is at 1.9% for 2021 and 2022 samples, 14% for 2023 samples
#We need to correct the weight for ambient moisture where the samples were measured into tin capsules

master$Ambient_Sample_Weight_g <- master$Dry_Sample_Weight_g*((100-master$Dry_sample_moisture_percent)/(100-master$Microbalance_moisture_percent))

str(master)
```

```{r}
#Total N uptake = g N per g of microbalanced sample (g/g)*total sample weight (g)/area harvested (m2) 
#then scale from g/m2 to kg/ha

master$N_total_kgha <- ((master$N_per_g_microbalanced_sample*master$Ambient_Sample_Weight_g)/1000) * (10000/master$Area_harvested_m2)
