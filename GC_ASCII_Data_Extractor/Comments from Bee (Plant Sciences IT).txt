Comment/Action: I spoke with Zhang on the phone on 5/9, and remotely connected to Linqu-Lab1-T. We were able to get the script working for non-admin users by installing the following packages for all users: 1. python latest stable release (3.12) 2. anaconda latest stable release 3. installing pandas using elevated cmd prompt We also set the environmental variable path for python when installing python (it's a checkbox option during install), but the script may run without setting the path. After installing all packages, the script ran correctly on setup. We then logged out of the setup account and Zhang logged in with his AD3 non-admin account, and the script ran with no problems. We did not have to make any other changes in order for the script to run, Zhang was able to run the script by dragging the sample *.txt file and dropping it onto the .py script (both were on the desktop). An excel file was then generated. I helped Zhang start a README.txt and noted the steps needed to install the 3 packages for all users on a domain joined lab computer. Zhang will continue editing/adding other notes to the README file. Closing work order.
